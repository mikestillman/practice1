Ubuntu 12 hint:

    I was working on Ubuntu 12.04, but I had to upgrade on Ubuntu 11.10, and, after some difficulties I find a solution to intall correctly M2 :
    1) I first get the  "libpari2-gmp" debian package at http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/pari/
    2) I install the  "libgmp3c2" package with an apt-get install
    3) I do a dpkg on the "libpari2-gmp" package
    4) A succesfully make an "apt-get install macaulay2".
