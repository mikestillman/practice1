Adding RRR and CCC linear algebra support

1. Make new rings (in ConcreteRing structure)
  1a. make RR_53 and RR_n (n > 53) different implementations
  1b. same with CC
  1c.  What about adaptive for a ring?

2. Add in DMat and SMat over these rings.
3. Write functions:
  rank
  determinant
  invert
  rankProfile
  nullSpace
  solveLinear
  addMultipleTo

  LU
  SVD
  eigenvalues
  eigenvectors
  leastSquares
  QR
  
  condition numbers (simpler approx, and better approx via SVD)
  +, -, scalar mult
  given eigenvalues, the following are not really needed:
    characteristicPolynomial
    minimalPolynomial

  LU gives:  m x n matrices, possibly close to rank deficient
    rank  (not well determined)  maybe: give Threshold=> option.
    determinant
    invert
    solveLinear
    nullSpace (not well determined)

  I imagine:
    aring-CC.hpp
    aring-CCC.hpp
    aring-RR.hpp
    aring-RRR.hpp
    aring-ZZp.hpp
    aring-ZZ.hpp
    ...
    template ConcreteRing<ARingCCC>;

Test:
   make simpler tests for inlining with templates

SLP
  separate big deal
  Mike: check with C.S. people (e.g. Dexter) about if anyone can improve SLP implementation.
  
  eventually: want nodes that represent elementary functions, and det.
