Here we keep the source for the d version of the translator.

Here is a bad bug:
    f(i:int):int := i;
    map2():int := (
	 bad := 0;
	 f(bad));
If you use the variable 'bad' in certain contexts, it causes some C code to be silently omitted.
In the example above, the definition of map2 is never put into the C code.
