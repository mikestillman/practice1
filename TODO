Add GroupRevLex to monomial order creation routines

Get resolutions back up and running

Get quotient rings functional: this includes getting fraction rings functional,
  and polynomial rings over that.  This includes having various routines
  like leadCoefficient do the right thing.

Polynomial rings should take a degree ring instead of a degree monoid.  Then we need a
way of specifying the trivial ring.

Go back to having a MutableMatrix class, which does not have free module information.
All mutable operations must be switched back.  Need a routine: map(Module,Module,MutableMatrix)
  - Write the remaining mutable matrix operations.
  - Change the interface to some of the rawMatrix commands.

statistics routine for Computation
  summary or stats for a computation should be in the toString.
  -- rawSummary(computation)
