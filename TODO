Add GroupRevLex to monomial order creation routines

Get resolutions back up and running

Get quotient rings functional: this includes getting fraction rings functional,
  and polynomial rings over that.  This includes having various routines
  like leadCoefficient do the right thing.

Polynomial rings should take a degree ring instead of a degree monoid.  Then we need a
way of specifying the trivial ring.
