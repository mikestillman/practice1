The files in this directory were taken from
an online article.  They are very simple, not
sophisticated, but are fine for my use.

important files:
C++ use
  test.{h,cpp} -- c++, defines class Test.  Does test.cpp compile?
  suite.{h,cpp}
C use
  Ctest.{h,c}
  CSuite.{h,c}

Example files
  CMain1.c, Main1.cpp, Main2.cpp
  stack.h stacktest.cpp
  comptest.cpp
  Bool.h
