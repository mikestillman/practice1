/*
 * monoid.cpp has been replaced with monoid1.cpp or monoid2.cpp
 * In order to switch which one you want: 
 *   change Makefile.in to use monoid1 or monoid2
 * and
 *   have monoid.hpp include monoid1.hpp or monoid2.hp
 * Currently it is not possible to have both in the program at once.
 * monoid1: old monomial code
 * monoid2: more flexible exponent vector based code
 * Perhaps also include other implementations.
