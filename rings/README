THIS DIRECTORY IS EXPERIMENTAL

This directory contains ring arithmetic code
Each basic type of ring has a small interface which may be used
  for template instantiation.
Polynomial rings have their own template code with some routines
  implemented.

The ring hierarchy
  This is done using inheritance, but most routines are
  implemented using the above interfaces

  Each ring type has code for vector arithmetic?  (this is
  how it is currently done).

polyring hierarchy
  -- These are implemented as (coeff, varpower) ?
PolynomialRing
  PolyRing -- elements are implemented as linked lists
    PolyRingSkew
    PolyRingWeyl
    PolyRingSolvable
    PolyRingQuotient
  PolyFrac -- elements are implemented as pairs (numerator,denominator)
    PolyFracQQ
    PolyFracField
    PolyFracRing
NCPolynomialRing
  NCPolyRingQuotient
