/*
 * varpower.cpp has been replaced with varpower1.cpp or varpower2.cpp
 * In order to switch which one you want: 
 *   change Makefile.in to use varpower1 or varpower2
 * and
 *   have varpower.hpp include varpower1.hpp or varpower2.hp
 * Currently it is not possible to have both in the program at once.
 * varpower1: old varpower code
 * varpower2: more verbose, handles larger exponents.
 * Perhaps also include other implementations.
